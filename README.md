# Quiz-Game-Engine

This project consists of a series of questions (stored in a text file with the related answers) to be answered by the user who, before starting the game, can select the difficulty which is divided in six levels. The program keeps track of the correct answers, displays the questions in a random order and stores the result in a text file.
